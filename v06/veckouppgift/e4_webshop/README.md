# Veckouppgift 6 Exercise 4 - webshop

Skapa klasser som representerar en webbshop:

* produkter (Product)  
* beställningar (Order)  
* kundvagn (ShoppingCart)

---

Focus from me have been on writing OOP code and not testing or TDD.  

I have created a webshop that can be used in the terminal.  
It connects to the Internet and uses DummyJSON API for products (https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).  
To run the program 'requests' needs to be install because of the API connection that it does. Run the 'main.py' file and you should get something in return in the terminal.  

Currently when this is written it is working as I think it should but I also want to tweak it in some places so it might get broken just becase of that :)
